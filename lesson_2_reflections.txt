What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? Git creates a .git directory, which is used to store the metadata for git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? The staging area is an interim step prior to committing. It provides an opportunity to rollback changes before they are committed.
