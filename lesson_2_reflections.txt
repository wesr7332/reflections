What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? Git creates a .git directory, which is used to store the metadata for git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? The staging area is an interim step prior to committing. It provides an opportunity to rollback changes before they are committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? You can git diff --staged the files in the staging area and the repository to determine the changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help? Branches can be used to work on new projects, such as a new experimental feature.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? They show the parents/children of branches and may also show any unreachable nodes.
